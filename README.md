# Twitch-Live-Streamer
A Twitch TV Live Streamer made using Twitch TV API as a part of Free Code Camp Curriculum :- https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/use-the-twitchtv-json-api

## Features :-  

  - Shows status of some popular channels on Twitch TV https://www.twitch.tv/
  - One of the three status :- Online, Offline , Account Closed.
  - If streamer is online then the app shows a brief information about what he is currently streaming.
  - Green Color is used to show online users.
  - Orangish Color to show offline or not existing users.

## Things I Learned :-
 
  - Using .forEach function to traverse array instead of for loop helped in accesing global values inside $getJSON functions.
  - When you have to use two depended $.getJSON use one inside of other because of asynchronous nature of AJAX. 
 
## Features to be implemented :-

  - Buttons to show all channels, only online channels, and only offline channels without page reload.
